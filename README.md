In this project I will create a simple etch-a-sketch board that changes the colors of squares in a grid as the user's mouse hovers over it. A reset button will allow the user to clear the board and choose a grid that ranges between 1x1 and 100x100.

What I learned:
- How to dynamically place multiple divs within the UI
- When to use event.target to manipulate elements
